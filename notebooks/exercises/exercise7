You should examine outgoing traffic to identify ACTUAL inside hosts. This traffic will originate from actual inside hosts. Incoming traffic is destined for addresses that the outside sender hopes exist; they may be simply addresses that are being probed.

You can make both sets with one command depending upon how you define “outside addresses.” It can be done if your definition is: external address to which outgoing traffic is directed, but not necessarily addresses from which inbound traffic originates.
